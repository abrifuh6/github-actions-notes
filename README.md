As you can see from the image above, events trigger the workflows.

 These workflows are set of tasks or actions .

## 1. Events

- First part specified in the yaml. It will be something like,

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
  - cron: 0 12 * * 1
```

- Some other github triggered events:
  - push, pull_request, public
  - Manually triggered:
    - worklfow_dispatch(external systems)

## 2. Workflows

- Workflows are like pipelines in jenkins, teamcity etc.
- Codify useful, customized proccesses.
- .yaml syntax
- .github/workflows (this is where you need to add your workflows folder)

workflow files glue together existing actions in sequence. 

- listen for particular events
- Then run pre-existing actions
- or shell scripts

- Actions run in VMs (Linux, Win, Mac)
  - or Docker on Linux vm
- Logs streaming & artifacts
- Secret store with each repo or organization.
